## Overview

### The challenge

When I saw the Lemonade's API page I really loved it! I was searching for a dark pallete website to recreate (to change a bit), and I really felt this one was THE ONE. It was a beautiful page with great illustrations, and that gave me the opportunity to also practice different types of animations, from intinite to on scroll ones.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Jquery
- Desktop-first workflow
- BEM Naming Convention
- SASS

### What I learned

At first I though it was gonna be an easy page to repicate but... as always, it had more to it than I first thought! I was a different way of responsive than what I'm used to so it was a really nice challenge! Also, the animations had a lot more to it too, they were made with a lot of different elements and different times, delays, etc... 
I think I've learnt a lot from this copycat, and it's a great addition to my portfolio!

### Continued development

I would love to get more confortable and get better with animations in general, it's still a ot of work and confusion for me! But I'll slowly but surely get to a point where I get better at it!
