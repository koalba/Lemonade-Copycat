## Overview

### The challenge

When I saw the Lemonade's API page I really loved it! I was searching for a dark pallete website to recreate (to change a bit), and I really felt this one was THE ONE. It was a beautiful page with great illustrations, and that gave me the opportunity to also practice different types of animations, from intinite to on scroll ones.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Naming Convention

### What I learned

This was quite a challenging project I must say, because I had to use forms a different way of what I'm used to (and I don't really use them that much either) so I had to do a bit of research to well... know what I was doing at least a bit. 

On the other hand, I got to use JavaScript which is always fun because I find myself researching how to do different things and I love when you make things work (eventhough maybe not in the best way.. yet). Like, for example, the .onkeydown().

At first I tried using it alone but everything was working so fast it didn't get the keys I just used, and later I leartn you can do a Timedown to fix it:

```js
document.querySelector(".d-grid__item--custom").onkeydown = function () {
  if (searchTimeout != undefined) clearTimeout(searchTimeout);
  searchTimeout = setTimeout(checkPercentage, 250);
};
```

And finally, but not less important, I'm trying to use BEM Naming Convention for my html id's and classes, which seemed easier than it is, because I'm still a bit confused on how to name some stuff, but I'm working on getting more confortable with it.

### Continued development

I'll still be trying to get better with the BEM Naming Convention and the Mobile-first workflow, which are pretty new to me, but I have to say I like them!

- [Stack Overflow - Determine when an user is typing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359887/determine-when-an-user-is-typing) - Thanks to this Stack Overflow thread I leartn about the timer, but .onkeypress() don't get the delete, space, etc. so...
- [Stack Overflow - JavaScript listener, "keypress" doesn't detect backspace?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4843472/javascript-listener-keypress-doesnt-detect-backspace) - In here I leartn about the existence of keydown and keyup.
